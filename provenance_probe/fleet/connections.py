"""Tier-2 observed-egress signal (B-phase): the loopback fan-out shape.

The config scan sees a `base_url=localhost:20128`; this sees the matching NETWORK
shape from the OS connection table: a local process that fans out from a loopback
port to many distinct upstreams is a router regardless of what it's named, and a
process connected to a known local-gateway port (OmniRoute/LiteLLM) is a client
using one. That is the `observed` evidence tier — stronger than `configured`.

Deliberate no-egress scope (see docs/fleet-posture.md): this reads the connection
table (`lsof -n`, no DNS) and never makes a network call. Two Tier-2 signals are
therefore OUT of scope here and stay deferred:
  * IP→operator attribution — a snapshot yields upstream IPs, and resolving an IP
    to a PRC operator needs reverse-DNS/RDAP (egress) — that is the prober's
    authorized `assess`/`network` path, not this no-egress collector.
  * JA3/TLS ClientHello fingerprint — needs raw packet capture (pcap/root).

Like the trust-store watch, this reads a privacy surface (per-process connections),
so it is inert until `--i-am-authorized`, and it REFUSES (never reports clean) when
the connection table cannot be read.
