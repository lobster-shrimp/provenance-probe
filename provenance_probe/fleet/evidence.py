"""Evidence model for fleet findings — tiers, classification, and the record.

Evidence tiers separate what we actually observed (Codex #4: "configured" is not
"effective traffic path"). The wedge only produces CONFIGURED evidence (reading
config files / env); ACTIVE_PROCESS and OBSERVED are B-phase but the field exists
so a finding never overstates what it rests on.
