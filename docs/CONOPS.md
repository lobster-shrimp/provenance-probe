# Agent Provenance Flight Recorder — Concept of Operations

For executives, federal / DoW leadership, and accreditation officials. Plain
language first, evidence second.

## The problem, in one sentence

When your organization fields an AI **agent** — a system that calls models in
steps and uses tools — a vendor can quietly route one of those steps to a
foreign-origin model, swap the model after you authorized it, or let a tool call
ship your data to foreign infrastructure, and you would have no way to see it.

## What this does

Point the harness at an agent you are authorized to test. It produces a
**per-step board**: for every step, which model actually answered, whether the
model changed across the run, and where each tool call sent data. The output is
signed evidence, not a hunch.

## What is reliable vs best-effort (read this before you cite a verdict)

Being honest about the measurement is the whole point of the tool.

- **Reliable — data egress jurisdiction.** Where a tool call physically sends
  data is observable and hard to fake. If an agent ships data to PRC-jurisdiction
  infrastructure, this catches it.
- **Reliable — model switch / drift.** A model changing across steps, or between
  runs over time, is detectable.
- **Best-effort — per-step provenance (which model family).** A CONFIRMED
  foreign-origin verdict is reachable **only** through an active probe of a
  reachable backend endpoint. From a trace alone, provenance floors at
  **INDETERMINATE** — a post-hoc trace carries no tokenizer signal, and a
  well-built agent can rewrite intermediate model output before it reaches the
  trace. The board says INDETERMINATE honestly rather than guessing.

## Threat cards

| Threat | What the adversary does | Feature that catches it | Reliability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data egress** | Agent tool call ships data to PRC-jurisdiction infra | Egress host → jurisdiction (`network` layer) | Strong |
| **Silent model swap** | Backend changes model after you authorized it | Re-probe + switch/drift detection | Strong (when re-probable) |
| **PRC jurisdiction** | Inference runs on a PRC operator / PRC soil | Network + registry analysis of the backend host | Medium (CDN-fronting can mask) |
| **Foreign-origin weights** | Vendor routes a step to a Chinese-origin model | Active backend tokenizer probe | Best-effort (CONFIRMED only with the active probe; else INDETERMINATE) |

## How to run it (Phase 1)

```bash
# Ingest a captured agent run (OpenTelemetry GenAI spans, or minimal JSON)
provenance-probe agent-trace run.json

# Config-driven, with an active backend probe (needs written authorization per backend)
provenance-probe agent --config agent.json --i-am-authorized
```

Exit code 2 signals a model switch was detected — wire it into CI or a monitor.

## Authorization

Assessing an agent widens the consent surface: you need written authorization for
the **agent operator AND every model backend** you actively probe. The tool
enforces this — each backend carries its own `authorized` flag, and active
probing aborts on the first unauthorized backend. Trace ingest of an
already-captured run needs only the authorization under which the run was
captured.

## Roadmap — all phases SHIPPED (2026-07-25)

- **Phase 1 ✓** — trace ingest, per-step board, egress mapping, active backend
  probe, per-backend authorization, this ConOps.
- **Phase 2 ✓** — live proxy interposition (`sentinel` tees SSE, fail-open), the
  `--export` signed-ready evidence pack (observatory signs it), sub-agent call
  graph (OTel `parentSpanId` / `X-Provenance-Parent` + `GET /agent/graph`), and
  the live board (`GET /agent/live`).
- **Phase 3 ✓** — continuous nightly agent monitoring (observatory `agent_monitor`
  drifts the agent fingerprint), agent-level numbered advisories (MPA, reusing the
  disclosure pipeline), and the adversarial red-team corpus (`redteam` command).
