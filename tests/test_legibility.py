"""WS2 (#115): non-technical legibility.

Two new surfaces, both sourced ONLY from ``explain.py`` (single source of truth):

  * :func:`explain.plain_answer` — one deterministic, plain-English sentence that
    LEADS the assess result (serve UI + CLI), a PURE function of the
    (provenance, jurisdiction, confidence) tuple so the two surfaces cannot drift.
  * :func:`explain.flow_html` / :func:`explain.flow_text` — the visual/plain-text
    "how it works" flow, both rendered from ``FLOW_STAGES`` + ``LAYERS``/``VERDICTS``.

These tests are the acceptance criteria: the full 25 x 3 grid (quality proxies +
the INDETERMINATE disclaimer), the flow structure/accessibility assertions, the
single-source guard, and the serve-vs-CLI drift test.
